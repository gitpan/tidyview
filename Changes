1.01 - None yet - first release.
1.02 - Correct type in project email.
     - additional notes in the README file.
1.03 - fixed bug where checkbox's didnt refresh properly after loading new config.
     - remember values of options not supported in GUI, so we write them out again on save.
     - lock text panes to central scrollbar, so code remains side-by-side.
     - disable text in text panes - this is not an editor.
     - remember what section we are in when we load a new config, and redraw with this section active.
1.04 - support for --no_XXX options
     - lock scrollbar and text panes together, but make text panes same length
1.05 - fixed issue where windows/cygwin file-insensitive filesystems couldnt detect difference between
       version.pm and Version.pm. Hence the operator qv() wasnt found, and a crash results.
1.06 - fixed bug in parameter to PT::R->parseConfig, causing loading of perltidy configs to fail
     - fixed minor inefficiency where section list was reconstructed over and over, when it can be done just once
     - fixed bug where a config section heading was being printed twice
1.07 - pod for CPAN indexing
1.08 - tweak MANIFEST
